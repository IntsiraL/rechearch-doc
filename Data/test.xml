   The opposition says Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's appointment as chief executive is just another
effort to perpetuate his dictatorship and makes democracy an even
more distant dream for Panama.
   The general's hand-picked legislature declared Panama in a state
of war on Friday and named Noriega chief executive to combat what
it called U.S. aggression.
   ``To confront this aggression, the job of chief of government of
Panama is hereby created, and Manuel Antonio Noriega is designated
to carry out these responsibilities as maximum leader for national
liberation,'' the resolution said.
   Noriega, chief of the Panamanian Defense Forces and already the
power behind the government, is wanted in the United States on
federal drug trafficking and money laundering charges.
   Washington has tried to oust him from power for 2{ years with
diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions. But the general has
weathered the U.S. pressure as well as military coups attempts in
March 1988 and in October.
   The 510-member assembly's resolution says Noriega can appoint
public officials, control foreign relations, convene the assembly
and ``make decisions on whatever other matter or unforeseen
circumstance'' affects the nation's interests.
   ``The Republic of Panama is declared to be in a state of war
while the (U.S.) aggression lasts,'' said the resolution, passed by
acclamation by the People's Assembly.
   Noriega was sworn in on the spot.
   ``This designation is a new imposition of a dictatorship that
exists only to perpetuate Noriega's power,'' a statement from the
Democratic Alliance of the Civic Opposition said.
   The alliance said Noriega's new title is a ``mere symbol.''
   Noriega, it said, ``has been exercising unlimited power since
the day he took command of the Defense Forces in 1983'' and the
appointment shows ``the dictatorial nature'' of his regime.
   It said Noriega's appointment was ``a step backward in the
search for a democratic solution'' that would only ``serve to
produce more and more complex problems'' for Panama.
   Nonetheless, the opposition reaffirmed its determinaton to
``keep struggling to achieve liberty and justice for the Panamanian
people.''
   In Washington, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger on Friday called Noriega's appointment ``a charade and
nonsense.''
   ``As far as we are concerned, at least, there is no government
in Panama anyway,'' he said.
   As head of the government, Noriega holds the same title as the
late dictator Gen. Omar Torrijos, his mentor.
   Noriega claims the U.S. indictments are part of a plot to renege
on the 1977 treaties signed by President Jimmy Carter and Torrijos
that turn over operation of the canal to Panama at the end of the
century.
   Noriega has propped up a succession of powerless presidents
while he controlled the country.
   Panama has not had an elected government since Sept. 1, when the
last presidential and legislative terms ended.
   Elections were held May 7 to fill those spots, but Noriega
annulled the balloting before all the votes were counted.
International observers said the opposition was winning by a 3-1
margin.
   Noriega then named Francisco Rodriguez, a friend since high
school, provisional president and appointed the nation's mayors and
county chairmen to the People's Assembly. Rodriguez's position was
expected to become a largely ceremonial post.
   Assembly members were applauded for attacks on the United
States. One asked the government for guns for all citizens
``because what we have to do here is kill gringos and pro-gringos.''

   A drawing found behind the wall of an Oklahoma
closet is being auctioned as the work of Pablo Picasso, but art
experts and the woman it supposedly portrays say they doubt its
authenticity.
   The owner of the pen-and-brush piece, jewelry engraver Jim
Montgomery of Norman, Okla., said Friday he had the work checked
out by a forensic document examiner in Oklahoma.
   It is up for sale at a weekend auction here by Kruse
International, an Auburn, Ind., auction house that specializes in
the sale of vintage cars. Kruse art director Jeff Doner said he
hopes for bids as high as $3 million to $5 million.
   Picasso's former mistress, the subject of the drawing, doubts it
is an authentic Picasso, and one expert said even if authentic it
would be worth no more than $250,000.
   Montgomery said he was given the work by a young couple he had
helped financially. The couple found the drawing of a young woman
about 11 years ago, tucked between two walls in the back of a
closet in an apartment they were renovating in Norman, he said.
   Recently, a friend suggested the drawing might be a Picasso, and
Montgomery decided to find out.
   ``It started out being a lot of fun and turned out to be a
tremendous amount of work,'' said Montgomery. ``But I had to know.''
   Montgomery had a scientific analysis done by Ernest Smith, a
forensic document examiner from Oklahoma City. He verified that the
ink of the signature was the same as that of the drawing, and
matched the signature with real Picasso signatures, among other
things.
   Montgomery acknowledged the drawing _ ``Portrait of a Young
Girl,'' isn't listed in Zervos, an extensive catalogue of Picasso
works.
   The drawing is said to be of Francoise Gilot, the mother of
Picasso's two grown children, Claude and Paloma. The late painter
used Ms. Gilot as a model from 1944 to 1953, when they lived
together.
   But the purported model doubts its authenticity.
   ``If they would want to know if it's correct, they would ask my
son or myself or my daughter,'' Ms. Gilot said in a telephone
interview from New York.
   ``The fact that they didn't ask anybody in the family is not a
good sign,'' said Ms. Gilot, a painter in her own right now married
to Jonas Salk, the developer of a polio vaccine.
   Art experts said Friday that scientific analysis is generally
only part of the verification process.
   A check of the Zervos catalogue ought to be the first step in
checking out such a work, said Virgilia Pancoast, of the
International Foundation for Art Research, in a telephone interview
from New York.
   ``The thing we would do beyond that ... the most crucial thing,
would be to go to a Picasso expert for an opinion,'' said Pancoast,
director of the authentication service for the non-profit
organization.
   ``It would seem reasonable to me that anyone attempting to sell
a work for that price would have the documentation to back it up.''
   John Richardson, a friend of Picasso who is writing a biography
of the late artist, also said an expert on the artist should have
been consulted.
   ``It's no good going to a forensic expert in Oklahoma City,'' he
said from New York. ``You have to go to a Picasso expert. They must
be desperate if they go to such a strange source for an opinion.''
   But both Richardson and Pancoast said the drawing could be
genuine.
   Even if authentic, the piece would be unlikely to reach seven
figures, Richardson said.
   ``A very high price would be $250,000,'' he said.

   The Christmas star said to have led
the three wise men to Bethlehem could have been a conjunction of
Jupiter, Saturn and Mars, a physicist says.
   The three planets were in conjunction _ appearing from Earth to
have merged _ in 6 B.C., about the time of the birth of Christ,
said Gary Henson, a physics professor at East Tennessee State
University.
   ``The combined light of all three of them would be brighter than
any star,'' Henson said.
   Other astronomical phenomenon also have been offered as
explanation for the Christmas story, including a supernova, or
exploding star, a comet, or Venus, which can shine very brightly at
times.
   One drawback to the conjunction theory, Henson notes, is that
the wise men were said to be educated in astronomy and should have
recognized the lining up of the three planets or some other
recurring astronomical event.
   ``Even many thousands of years ago, they knew the motions of the
planets,'' Henson said. ``If it was one of those natural objects,
they should have been aware of it.''

   His age and size, combined with his ties to
the business community, prove Santa Claus is a Republican, a Rotary
Club has determined.
   Since they weren't able to check his voter registration,
Rotarians in this Portland suburb could only guess Santa's
political affiliation. But more than half of the 60 people
attending Thursday's debate, most of whom were Republicans, decided
to claim the jolly old elf as one of their own.
   Tigard city administrator Pat Reilly said Santa, like most
Republicans, is an older man dedicated to family values.
   The fact that St. Nick has lent his jolly image to marketing
schemes indicates he's sympathetic to business interests, said
Reilly. His concept of merit pay _ gifts only for the nice _ also
fits the Republican image.
   But Bill Knudsen, director of Tigard Community Youth Services,
disagreed.
   If Santa were a true Republican, Knudsen said, he'd live in
balmy Palm Beach instead of the North Pole.
   An then there's that long, white beard.
   ``I mean, maybe he'd have a pencil-thin mustache, but everyone
knows it's illegal in America for a Republican to wear a beard,''
Knudsen said.

   Giving your true love all the gifts
mentioned in ``The 12 Days of Christmas'' would cost $8,401 this
year.
   That's the estimate of Texas Comptroller Bob Bullock, who notes
state and local sales tax would have to be added in many areas.
   Here's the rundown, at Texas prices:
   _ A partridge, $40.
   _ Two turtle doves, $25.
   _ Three French hens, $18.
   _ Four calling birds, $250.
   _ Five golden rings, $648.
   _ Six geese-a-laying $90.
   _ Seven swans a-swimming, $7,000.
   _ Eight maids a-milking, at a salary of $200 a day.
   _ A pair of ballet tickets to see nine ladies dancing and 10
lords leaping, $50.
   _ Eleven pipers piping and 12 drummers drumming could be had for
two $40 symphony tickets.
   If it all seems a bit much, there's always a card, about $1.50.

   Visitors who drive hundreds of miles to
see the tiny town named after St. Nick are greeted by a sorry Santa
who slumps and groans.
   Some residents say the condition of the 30-foot fiberglass Santa
on the edge of town is embarassing. Others say it's downright
dangerous.
   ``People stop there all the time to sit their kids on his boots
and snap pictures,'' said Marlin Rook. ``Wouldn't it be tragic if
someone was standing there and Santa Claus fell on them?''
   Santa is slumped forward on crumpled boots, with only a steel
cable to support his weight. When the winter wind whistles by, the
not-so-jolly old elf rocks and moans.
   The statue beside Highway 245 is the most prominent of two Santa
Clauses still standing of four the Chamber of Commerce erected in
1981. One was blown over and another, located near a high school,
had to be removed after students covered it with graffiti.
   Last year, Mrs. Rook and resident Cammie Pruss repainted the
statue. But in July, Santa began to slump forward. Since then, he's
steadily gotten worse.
   Now a property is considering loaning money for some of the
needed repairs, estimated at from $2,500 to $3,000.
   ``A lot of people who live here have lived here all their lives
and they don't realize how neat it is,'' said Mrs. Pruss, who is
from Pittsburgh. ``You don't see these statues of Santa Claus
standing around everywhere.''
